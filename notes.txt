MODULES
- They are encapsulated code (only share minimum)

- every file in node by default is a MODULES
- some powerful built-in modules in node include OS, PATH, FS, and HTTP

EVENT LOOP
- it's the core of non blocking I/O model in Node.js.
- It allows node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations - despite the fact that JS is single-threaded -- by offloading operations to the system kernel (multi-threaded) whenever possible

STREAMS
//streams are used to read and write sequentially
// four types of streams are 1. writeable 2. readable 3. duplex 4. transform
// they extend the EventEmitter class

PLANETS_PROJECT
- in node, all streams are implemented Using EventEmitters
- it is a great idea to stream large data sets

WEB SERVERS
- An API is a software intermediary that allows communication btw 2 apps
